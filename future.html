        <h1>My Future</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>In the near future, I will keep working at the production company whilst getting my degree. After I have my
            degree, I want to work in IT. This could be as a systems administrator, a developer or working in systems
            analysis.</p>
        <p>I intend to keep running my homelab for personal use as it allows me to experiment with computing in a
            low-risk environment.</p>
        <p>I intend to keep living in Sydney in the short term, however would like to travel at some point, perhaps living 
            overseas or in another city. Currently I am learning French.</p>
