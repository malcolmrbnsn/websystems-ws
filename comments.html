        <p>My website was created with simple HTML and CSS. As I have worked on more complex websites using Javascript 
            frameworks such as react, I wanted to see how simple and functional I could make a website. This went well 
            as I was able to meet my criteria effectively.</p>


        <h2>Design and Asthetics</h2>
        <p>I aimed to create a simple, easy user experience. This was primarily done by making sure all information
            could be accessed on the navigation bar. This made the navigation bar a central aspect of the website.</p>
        <p>Instead of using my typical black, white and grey colour scheme, I decided to add some colour to my website
            in the form of a color palette of reds and greys.</p>
        <p>I wanted to use simple styles, such as using one appropriate font, built-in headers and uniform layouts.</p>

        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <p>Whilst creating my website, I aimed to increase re-usability in my code. This occured through the use of
            classes and element stylings that could be used in all pages. Using the one CSS file for the entire website
            helped with this.</p>
        <p>In terms of layout, all pages share the same common setup. At the top of the page is the navigation bar, simply 
            a <code>div</code> with the class <code>nav</code>, and a list of links as <code>a</code> with the class 
            <code>navlink</code>.</p>
        <p>Below this, I use a <code>div</code> with the class <code>container</code> to add padding to the sides of the website. 
            The <code>container</code> class also changes the padding applied to the sides based on the size of the display.</p>
        <p>I used <code>H1</code>, <code>H2</code>, and <code>H3</code> tags to organise the information on my website. I used 
            a <code>H1</code> with a <code>hr</code> at the top of all pages to create a uniform layout.</p>
        <p>I used the <code>centered</code> and <code>dynamic</code> class to ensure that images resized once the display was smaller than the image, 
            preventing horizontal scrolling. This class also centres the image within the container.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Whilst choosing colours, I made sure that text would be legible by first testing, then using a
            checker on the internet to make sure that my colour choices were within legible standards.</p>
        <p>When I added an image to my website, I included an alternative text within the image tag to ensure that the
            image would be understood by screen readers or if the image failed to load.</p>
        <p>I used Google Chrome's Lighthouse tab in the inspector to run an automated test for accessibility to make
            sure I didn't miss anything.</p>
